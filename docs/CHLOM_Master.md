# CHLOM Master Document

## Overview

CHLOM™ — the Compliance Hybrid Licensing & Ownership Metaprotocol — is a decentralized licensing engine combining artificial intelligence, smart contracts and fingerprint-based IP protection for more than 60 real‑world use cases. It defines how media creators, licensors and sublicensees can exchange rights and payments safely on chain while preserving privacy and regulatory compliance.

This master document consolidates three layers of specification:

- **BlackPaper** – the formal model, properties and proofs that guarantee CHLOM works correctly under standard cryptographic and Byzantine fault assumptions.
- **Technical White Paper** – the system architecture and API-level specification of the licensing contracts, registries, override tree, splitter, treasuries, governance and zero-knowledge verification flows.
- **Execution Manual (Gold Layer)** – operational guidance, gas and storage budgets, ZK circuit templates, MEV and rounding analysis, cross‑chain bridging options, Monte Carlo calibration playbooks, and developer scaffolds for Foundry and TLC.

Each layer builds on the previous one: the BlackPaper proves safety, liveness, privacy, attribution uniqueness, value conservation, incentive compatibility and other target properties; the White Paper translates the proofs into implementable contracts and APIs; the Gold layer calibrates parameters and provides practical artifacts to run, test and audit the protocol.

## Properties (P1–P13)

- **P1 Value Conservation** — Splitter and override disbursements neither create nor destroy value; payouts add up to the base amount.
- **P2 Capacity Safety** — Finalized cumulative usage never exceeds the `cap` specified in a license.
- **P3 Attribution Uniqueness** — Decentralized identifiers (DID) constructed as `did = H(pk || salt)` collide only with negligible probability given collision‑resistant hashes.
- **P4 ZK‑Compliance Correctness & Privacy** — Accepted zero‑knowledge proofs imply the usage predicate holds without revealing the witness.
- **P5 Eventual Enforcement** — Valid enforcement events finalize within bounded time under a BFT ledger with up to `f < n/3` faulty validators.
- **P6 Incentive Compatibility** — With calibrated stake `S`, slashing factor `s` and detection probability `p`, rational deviation yields non‑positive expected gain.
- **P7 Audit Immutability** — Finalized audit events cannot be altered unless the underlying BFT ledger safety is broken.
- **P8 Compositional Compliance** — Multi‑stage compliance enforces the conjunction of all predicates `C_i`.
- **P9 Batch‑Order Invariance** — Aggregate payouts are independent of transaction ordering or batching.
- **P10 Subtree‑Revocation Conservation** — Revoking a subtree of the override tree preserves global conservation and prevents leakage to revoked nodes.
- **P11 Rounding‑Error Bound** — With fixed‑point payouts, accumulated rounding error is bounded by `m‑1` units and the residual is conserved.
- **P12 Collusion Thresholds** — No coalition with stake less than 1/3 can censor indefinitely; breaking finality requires more than 2/3 stake and is economically disincentivized.
- **P13 Oracle Accountability** — Misreporting oracles incur strictly negative expected value when deposits and slashing exceed the gain of lying.

## Invariants (I1–I9)

- **I1 Splitter Sum** — The weights vector `w` sums to 1 and each weight is non‑negative.
- **I2 Capacity** — Usage counter satisfies `0 ≤ used ≤ cap`.
- **I3 Nonce** — The nonce increases strictly on every accepted transition to prevent replay.
- **I4 Authorization** — Every state transition is signed by an authorized DID key.
- **I5 Audit Link** — Each payout references a unique `(license, event)` pair; duplicates are rejected.
- **I6 ZK Acceptance ⇒ Policy** — If the verifier accepts a proof, the corresponding predicate holds.
- **I7 Override Graph** — The override structure is an acyclic connected tree.
- **I8 Replay Resistance** — Transactions include the current nonce, and replays are invalid.
- **I9 Finality Respect** — Contract state is read only from finalized blocks.

## Key Theorems

These theorems connect the invariants to the properties and show CHLOM’s mechanics are correct.

- **Thm 1 – Value Conservation (Splitter)**: For base payment `B ≥ 0` and weights summing to 1, the total payout is `B`.
- **Thm 2 – Override Correctness**: In a rooted tree with edge rates in `[0,1]`, ancestor payouts equal the base times the product of rates along the unique path; summed payouts telescope to the base.
- **Thm 3 – Capacity Safety**: With nonce monotonicity and a guard that rejects `used' > cap`, no finalized history can exceed the cap.
- **Thm 4 – Attribution Uniqueness**: Collision‑resistant hashes ensure distinct principals have unique DIDs except with negligible probability.
- **Thm 5 – ZK Compliance Correctness & Privacy**: Soundness guarantees the predicate holds; zero‑knowledge hides the witness.
- **Thm 6 – Eventual Enforcement**: Under BFT liveness, non‑censored valid transactions finalize within bounded rounds.
- **Thm 7 – Incentive Compatibility**: Deviation is non‑profitable when `S ≥ G/(p s)` for gain `G`, detection probability `p` and slashing `s`.
- **Thm 8 – Audit Immutability**: Finalized events cannot be altered without breaking BFT safety.
- **Thm 9 – Compositional Compliance**: Advancing the contract only when all proofs verify ensures the conjunction of predicates holds.
- **Thm 10 – Batch‑Order Invariance**: Payouts computed batch-wise commute and associate, so totals are independent of ordering.
- **Thm 11 – Subtree Revocation Conservation**: Revoking a subtree stops future payouts to revoked nodes while conserving value among the remaining tree.
- **Thm 12 – Rounding‑Error Bound**: Flooring fixed‑point payouts yields a residual `r` in `[0, m–1]` which is deterministically assigned and conserves value.
- **Thm 13 – Collusion Thresholds**: Censorship is impossible for stake `< 1/3`; rewriting finalized history requires stake `> 2/3` and thus slashed deposits exceed potential gain.
- **Thm 14 – Oracle Accountability**: With a deposit `S_V` and slashing factor `s_V`, misreporting oracles incur negative expected value if `p_detect s_V S_V` exceeds the benefit of lying.
- **Thm 15 – Cross‑Chain Settlement Safety**: If mirrored tokens on a secondary chain mint only after a light‑client proof of finality, conservation and immutability extend to the bridged chain.

## Mechanization & Verification

- **TLA+ specification:** Encode state variables (`L.state`, `L.used`, `L.cap`, `L.nonce`, `S.w`, `T`, ledger) and invariants `I1–I9` in TLA+. Use `Init` to set initial roles, capacities and weights; define `Next` to capture state transitions (usage, payout, revoke, verify). Model check safety and liveness with `TLC`.
- **Hoare triples:** Express pre/post conditions for smart-contract functions in Solidity/Vyper (e.g., require the sum of weights equals `1e18`, require `used + Δ ≤ cap`, require `VerifyZK(π)` before state changes).
- **ZK circuits:** Implement policy predicates `C(x)` (e.g., `age ≥ 18`, `geo ∈ allowed`, `risk ≤ τ`) and compile to Circom/Noir. Soundness of the proving system yields P4.
- **Economic calibration:** Compute required stake levels given worst-case deviation gain `G`, detection probability `p` and slashing factor `s`. Extend to colluding coalitions by aggregating gains and stakes.
- **Stress cases:** Handle simultaneous finalization near cap (I3 ensures only one success), rounding residuals (Theorem 12), batch MEV (Theorem 10), revocation storms (Theorem 11) and oracle griefing (Theorem 14).
