# CHLOM™ BlackPaper — Formal Proof & Verification Master (v1.3)

## Introduction

This BlackPaper provides a rigorous proof framework for the Compliance Hybrid Licensing & Ownership Metaprotocol (CHLOM™). It formalizes the protocol’s cryptographic assumptions, defines the exact safety and liveness properties, states invariants for smart contract implementation, and proves that CHLOM achieves its goals when these invariants hold. The paper also sketches a mechanization plan using TLA+ and Foundry.

## Formal Model

### Primitives & Assumptions

```
- H: {0,1}* → {0,1}^k is collision resistant.
- Signature scheme is EUF‑CMA secure.
- Zero‑knowledge system is sound and zero‑knowledge.
- Ledger B is Byzantine fault tolerant with finality and liveness if at most f < n/3 validators are faulty.
```

### Entities

- Principals `P` (creators, licensees, sublicensees, validators).
- DID registry maps public keys to decentralised identifiers via `did = H(pk || salt)`.
- Oracles V (violation reporting) and A (analytics/attestation) submit signed evidence.

### Contracts & State

- **License L**: holds `state ∈ {Draft, Active, Suspended, Revoked, Expired}`, `used ∈ ℕ`, `cap ∈ ℕ ∪ {∞}`, `nonce ∈ ℕ`.
- **Splitter S**: weight vector `w = (w_1, …, w_m)` with `w_i ≥ 0` and `∑_i w_i = 1`.
- **Override Tree T**: rooted tree over licensors; each edge e tagged with rate `r_e ∈ [0,1]`.
- **Registry R**: maps DIDs to authorized keys and roles.
- **Treasury T**: receives base payments and disburses according to Splitter and Override Tree.
- **Governance G**: enforces state transitions based on oracle inputs, zero‑knowledge verifications and signatures.

### Compliance & Privacy

Policy predicates `C(x) = 1` operate over private usage data x. The holder supplies a proof π that there exists x satisfying C(x) = 1; on‑chain verification returns `⊤` or `⊥`.

### Economics

Actors with enforcement power stake S > 0 with slashing factor `s ∈ (0,1]`. Detection probability for deviations is `p > 0`, and illicit gain bound G ≥ 0.

## Target Properties (P1–P13)

P1 **Value Conservation**: Payments are neither created nor destroyed by Splitter and Override Tree.  
P2 **Capacity Safety**: Finalized usage never exceeds cap.  
P3 **Attribution Uniqueness**: Distinct principals collide on DID only with negligible probability.  
P4 **ZK‑Compliance Correctness & Privacy**: Accepted proofs imply the predicate holds and reveal no private data.  
P5 **Eventual Enforcement (Liveness)**: Valid enforcement events finalize within bounded time.  
P6 **Incentive‑Compatibility**: With calibrated stake S, slashing s and detection p, rational deviation yields non‑positive expected gain.  
P7 **Audit Immutability**: Finalized audit events cannot be altered unless BFT safety is broken.  
P8 **Compositional Compliance**: Multi‑stage compliance enforces the conjunction of all predicates.  
P9 **Batch‑Order Invariance**: Aggregate payouts are independent of transaction ordering or batching.  
P10 **Subtree‑Revocation Conservation**: Revoking a subtree of the override tree preserves global conservation and prevents leakage to revoked nodes.  
P11 **Rounding‑Error Bound**: With fixed‑point payouts, accumulated rounding error is bounded by `m−1` units and the residual is conserved.  
P12 **Collusion Thresholds**: No coalition with stake ≤1/3 can censor indefinitely; rewriting finalized history requires >2/3 stake.  
P13 **Oracle Accountability**: Misreporting oracles incur strictly negative expected value when deposits and slashing exceed the gain of lying.

## Invariants (I1–I9)

I1 **Splitter Sum**: The weights vector w sums to 1 and each weight is non‑negative.  
I2 **Capacity**: Usage counter satisfies `0 ≤ used ≤ cap`.  
I3 **Nonce**: The nonce increases strictly on each accepted transition to prevent replay.  
I4 **Authorization**: Every state transition is signed by an authorized DID key.  
I5 **Audit Link**: Each payout references a unique `(license, event)` pair; duplicates are rejected.  
I6 **ZK Acceptance ⇒ Policy**: If `Verify(π) = ⊤` then the compliance predicate holds.  
I7 **Override Graph**: The override tree is acyclic and connected.  
I8 **Replay‑Resistance**: Transactions include the current nonce; replays are invalid.  
I9 **Finality Respect**: State queries use only finalized blocks.

## Key Theorems (T1–T15)

T1 **Value Conservation (Splitter)**: For base B ≥ 0 and weights summing to 1, the total payout equals B.  
T2 **Override Correctness**: In a rooted tree with edge rates in [0,1], ancestor payouts equal the base times the product of rates along the unique path; sums telescope to B.  
T3 **Capacity Safety**: With nonce monotonicity and cap checks, no finalized history can exceed cap.  
T4 **Attribution Uniqueness**: If `did = H(pk || salt)` and H is collision‑resistant, distinct principals share a DID only with negligible probability.  
T5 **ZK Compliance Correctness & Privacy**: If the verifier accepts π and the ZK system is sound and zero‑knowledge, then there exists x satisfying C(x) = 1 and no further information is revealed.  
T6 **Eventual Enforcement**: Under BFT liveness and a non‑zero report rate, valid enforcement transactions finalize within bounded rounds.  
T7 **Incentive Compatibility**: With stake S, slashing s and detection p, deviation with gain G is non‑profitable when `S ≥ G / (p · s)`.  
T8 **Audit Immutability**: Finalized events cannot be altered without violating BFT safety.  
T9 **Compositional Compliance**: Advancing the contract only when all `Verify(π_i) = ⊤` enforces the conjunction of all predicates.  
T10 **Batch‑Order Invariance**: Aggregate payouts are associative and commutative; batching does not affect totals.  
T11 **Subtree‑Revocation Conservation**: Revoking a subtree stops future payouts to revoked nodes while preserving conservation for the remaining tree.  
T12 **Rounding‑Error Bound**: The residual r is bounded by `m−1` and value is conserved.  
T13 **Collusion Thresholds**: A coalition with stake less than 1/3 cannot censor indefinitely; rewriting finalized history requires more than 2/3 stake.  
T14 **Oracle Accountability**: Misreporting oracles suffer negative expected value when detection probability times slashing exceeds the benefit of lying.  
T15 **Cross‑Chain Safety**: If minting on chain Y requires a light‑client proof of finality on chain X, then conservation and immutability extend to Y.

## Mechanization Blueprint

- **TLA+ Spec**: Encode variables (`L.state`, `L.used`, `L.cap`, `L.nonce`, `S.w`, `T`, `Ledger`) and invariants I1–I9. Use temporal logic to assert that valid enforcement events eventually finalize.  
- **Solidity/Vyper Guards**: Implement require statements for weight sums, cap checks, nonce increments, signature verification and ZK proof checks.  
- **ZK Circuits**: Encode policy predicates `C(x)` (age ≥ 18, geo within allowed set, risk ≤ threshold, etc.) and ensure on‑chain verifier matches circuit outputs.  
- **Economic Calibration**: For each actor type, list plausible illicit gains G, choose detection probability p and slashing factor s, and compute the minimum stake `S ≥ G/(p·s)`. Extend to coalitions by aggregating gains and stakes.

## Stress Cases & Resolutions

- **Simultaneous finalize near cap**: Nonce monotonicity and single canonical chain ensure only one increment succeeds.  
- **Partial refunds & rounding**: Residuals are bounded by m−1 and assigned deterministically.  
- **Batch payouts & MEV**: Batch ordering does not affect totals; receipts prevent micro‑level disputes.  
- **Revocation storms**: Revoking subtrees halts payouts to revoked nodes without affecting past payouts.  
- **Oracle griefing**: Deposits and slashing make misreporting unprofitable.

## Executive Summary

CHLOM works because each property (P1–P13) is proven under clear cryptographic and economic assumptions. By mapping these properties to invariants (I1–I9) and implementing them in smart contracts, model checkers and zero‑knowledge circuits, we ensure that the system maintains value conservation, capacity safety, attribution uniqueness, privacy, liveness, incentive compatibility and audit immutability. The additional theorems on batch‑order invariance, subtree‑revocation conservation, rounding bounds, collusion thresholds and oracle accountability extend the framework to handle real‑world corner cases.
